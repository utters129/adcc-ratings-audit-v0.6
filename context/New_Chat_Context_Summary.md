## Key Technical Achievements

### Numerical Stability
- Resolved "Result too large" errors in Glicko-2 algorithm
- Implemented comprehensive bounds checking and fallback mechanisms
- Added iteration limits and error handling for robust calculations

### Data Integration
- Seamless integration between all analytics components
- Consistent data flow across rating, record, and medal systems
- Comprehensive reporting with Excel output

### Testing & Validation
- All components thoroughly tested with edge cases
- Data consistency validation across systems
- End-to-end functionality verification

## Project Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture with:
- **Core Models**: Pydantic-based data structures
- **Data Processing**: Robust pipeline with validation
- **Storage**: Parquet and JSON with state management
- **Analytics**: Glicko-2 ratings, records, medals, and reporting
- **Testing**: Comprehensive verification at each phase

## Development Standards
- Systematic phase-based development
- Comprehensive testing and verification
- Robust error handling and logging
- Industry best practices throughout

## Next Steps
Ready to begin **Phase 6: File Acquisition System** which will implement:
- Automated file downloading from Smoothcomp
- File processing and validation
- Integration with existing analytics pipeline

The project is progressing excellently with all phases completed successfully and thoroughly verified.
