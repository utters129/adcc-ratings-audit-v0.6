# ADCC Analysis Engine v0.6 - Development Checklist

## 🎯 Development Principles

### **Always Follow These Rules:**
1. **Phase-by-Phase Development**: Never skip phases or work on multiple phases simultaneously
2. **Test-First Approach**: Write tests before implementing features
3. **Incremental Building**: Each module must work independently before integration
4. **Extensive Logging**: Log every operation for debugging
5. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling at every level
6. **Documentation**: Document every function, class, and module
7. **Code Quality**: Use pre-commit hooks and follow PEP 8
